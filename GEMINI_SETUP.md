2. Set the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Update the `env` section in both config files

### 3. Update Configuration
The settings.json file at `~/.gemini/settings.json` has been updated with the MCP server configuration.

### 4. Restart Gemini CLI
1. Completely quit Gemini CLI
2. Restart the application
3. Check that MCP servers are connected

## üß™ Testing the Setup

### Test Server Locally
```bash
# Test the server directly
python server.py
```

### Test with Gemini CLI
1. Open Gemini CLI
2. Try asking: "What tools are available?"
3. Test a tool: "List my recent Gmail messages"

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connecting
1. Check that the Python path in config files is correct
2. Verify the working directory (`cwd`) exists
3. Ensure the conda environment is activated

### Tools Not Available
1. Restart Gemini CLI completely
2. Check Gemini CLI logs for errors
3. Verify both config files are in the correct location

### Google API Errors
1. Check that `credentials.json` exists (if using Gmail/Calendar)
2. Verify `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Ensure API services are enabled in Google Cloud Console

## üìù Example Usage

- "Search for emails from my boss"
- "Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting"

- "Show my upcoming calendar events"
- "Create a meeting tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "What's on my calendar this week?"

**Maps:**
- "Get directions from San Francisco to San Jose"
- "Find restaurants near Times Square"
- "What are the coordinates of the Eiffel Tower?"

## üîê Security Notes

- Keep your `credentials.json` file secure
- Don't commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate your API keys

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the server logs for error messages
2. Verify all configuration paths are correct
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Test the server independently before using with Gemini CLI
